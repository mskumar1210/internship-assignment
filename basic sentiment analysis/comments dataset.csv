I love the art style of manhwa!
Manga has a more unique storytelling approach.
I prefer reading manhwa over manga any day!
Manga often feels more detailed and immersive.
I don't really enjoy either.
Manhwa tends to be more colorful and vibrant!
I dislike how manhwa is often just copying manga.
"Both have their strengths, but I like manga better."
Manhwa characters are often more relatable.
I find manga boring compared to manhwa.
